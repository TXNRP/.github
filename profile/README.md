# Oh boy, we got a wanderer over here!
Hey there, fellow gamer! You've found the GitHub organization that powers our FiveM Roleplay server, TX Network. Let's dive into what this is all about, in plain gamer lingo.

**What's the Score?** <br>
Alright, so this GitHub place is where we cook up all the goodness you see on the server. It's like our digital secret base where our squad of developers comes together to create, tweak, and keep our FiveM Roleplay server at its best.

**What's the Lowdown?** <br>
You're in for a treat! Inside our GitHub organization, we've got all the key components that make TX Network stand out. Think sweet vehicles, game-changing mechanics, and other cool tools. Now, here's the twist - most of our repositories are kept private which means they're invite-only, super exclusive stuff. GitHub is essentially our headquarters where our team of developers collaborate with one another to keep everything in top shape.

**Ready to Join the Squad?** <br>
You bet! If you've got the skills and want to be a part of our exclusive development team, head over to our main website txnrp.com, fill out a developer application, and who knows, you might get the chance to join our ~~shitposting~~ development team.
